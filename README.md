# preprocessing_pipeline_fmri
During (f)MRI brain scans, it is common practice to collect a high-resolution scan of the brain (Â±5 minutes) and multiple lower contrast functional scans that can be completed in 500-2000ms while the subject is performing a task in the scanner. This script ensures all scans are alligned by means of linear and non-linear translations, ICA-based noise components are rejected, brain regions of interest are selected, spatial smoothing is applied where necessary, time courses are de-noised, and general linear models are applied to locate regions of the brain that respond to task-based events. 


This pipeline utilises a combination of function from:
